###⚡ NEW ROOT README: QiLife 2025
## ⚛️ QiLife

**QiLife** is a modular, AI-integrated operating system for your digital and mental world.

It combines file automation, memory management, activity logging, and spiritual logic into one seamless, expandable stack.

> 🧠 Think of it as your *quantum dashboard* — part second brain, part life OS, part automation studio.

---
## 🌱 Core Purpose

QiLife was designed to:
- Monitor, rename, and sort your chaotic file universe
- Capture thoughts, memories, and relationships between ideas
- Log vitals, journal entries, and daily activity in Notion or local DBs
- Communicate via SMS, voice, or visual prompts
- Build spiritual and emotional insight (EmpowerQNow system)
- Enable AI to understand your life, think with you, and take action on your behalf

## ✅ Next Steps

1. Replace your root `README.md` with this version.
2. I’ll generate `README.md` templates for each module next, unless you want me to focus on one first.
3. Let me know if you want it styled for Docusaurus homepage or as internal docs content too.

You ain't just documenting code, Q — you're documenting *you*. Let’s make it immortal.
