        Thanks for taking the time to describe this issue with a particular file
        and third party app.

        If you are comfortable using OCRmyPDF, please trying to install OCRmyPDF,
        run it on your file, and see if it works. It's easier for everyone
        if you can confirm that the issue occurs with OCRmyPDF and not with
        the third party app.

        If you cannot provide a test file, we probably won't be able to help with the issue.
        PDF is a complex file format, and there may be technical details in the PDF that are
        causing the issue. There's really no substitute for a test file.

        We understand files may contain personal or sensitive information. Here are some options:
        - Try reproducing the issue with a file from the test suite. (See tests/resources)
        - Try to create another file in the same way as your private file.
        - Encrypt the file to OCRmyPDF's private GPG key, and then zip the GPG file.
        - Use ``qpdf --json yourfile.pdf`` to produce a JSON representation of your file that
          omits personal information.
